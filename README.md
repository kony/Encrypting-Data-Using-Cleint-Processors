# Encrypting-Data-Using-Cleint-Processors

This article demonstrates the usage of Data pre and post processors for encrypting-decrypting data over the network. 
As part of this article will implement Banking application for admin which allows the addition of card details for the user, 
updating the address of the user and getting details of all the user with address and card number. 
Since application contains sensitive data like card number, user address etc. and all the operations use network call, 
so application encrypts all the sensitive data over the network with the combination of client and middleware 
Data Pre and Post processors for encryption and decryption.
